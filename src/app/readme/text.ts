for the first time, reaching $2113 billion. Global spending in 2021 was 0.7
per cent higher than in 2020 and 12 per cent higher than in 2012. The economic
effects of the Covid-19 pandemic have not ended the continuous upward trend in
world military expenditure seen since 2015. As a result of the strong economic
recovery across the globe in 2021, world military spending as a share of world
gross domestic product—the global military burden—reached 2.2 per cent, down
from 2.3 per cent in 2020. Average military spending as a share of government
expenditure in 2021 remained the same as in 2020, at 5.9 per cent. This Fact
Sheet presents regional and national military expenditure data for 2021 and
highlights trends over the decade 2012–21. The data comes from the updated
SIPRI Military Expenditure Database, which provides military spending data by
country for the years 1949–2021.`;
